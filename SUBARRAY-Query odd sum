Given an array of integers and Q queries, each query contains three integers l, r and K. For each query, if we change all elements in the range Al, Al+1,â€¦, Ar of the array to K, check if the sum of the entire array will be odd. If the sum is odd then print YES along with sum, else NO.

Note: The queries are independent and do not affect future queries.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases.
The second line of the input contains N - size of an array and Q - number of queries. The third line contains N - array elements.
Next Q lines consists of three integers l, r, K.

Output Format
For each query print "YES" if the sum of the entire array becomes odd along with sum, and "NO" otherwise, separated by a newline.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= N, Q <= 103
1 <= K <= 103

70 points
1 <= N, Q <= 105
1 <= K <= 106

General Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Ai <= 104
0 <= l <= r < N

Example
Input
1
5 3
2 2 1 3 2
1 2 3
1 2 4
0 3 9

Output
YES 13
YES 15
NO

Explanation

Given array [2,2,1,3,2]
Q1 : [2,3,3,3,2], sum = 13, which is odd
Q2 : [2,4,4,3,2], sum = 15, which is odd
Q2 : [9,9,9,9,2], sum = 38, which is even
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we solve this by creating a prefix sum array.And then make 3 values total,old,new and then ans=total-old+new.old taken from prefix array ,new is calculated,total is prefix[n].
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n,a=map(int,input().split())
    li=list(map(int,input().split()))
    p=[0]*(n+1)
    for i in range(n):
        p[i+1]=p[i]+li[i]
    total=p[n]
    for _ in range(a):
        l,r,k=map(int,input().split())
        old=p[r+1]-p[l]
        new=(r-l+1)*k
        ans=total-old+new
        if ans%2==1:
            print("YES",ans)
        else:
            print("NO")
