Given a 2D matrix of size NxN, print the sum of the elements of all its diagonals.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the N - the size of the matrix. Each of the next N lines contains N integers - the elements of the matrix.

Output Format
For each test case, print the sum of the elements of all the diagonals, separated by a new line. Refer to samples for more clarity.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100

Explanation

Test Case 1 
Sum of the elements of the 1st diagonal: 4
Sum of the elements of the 2nd diagonal: 0 + -6 = -6
Sum of the elements of the 3rd diagonal: -5 + 8 + 1 = 4
Sum of the elements of the 4th diagonal: 2 + 7 = 9
Sum of the elements of the 5th diagonal: 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we solve this by simply creating of some size and storing(+=) the diagonal matrix values into it.. just by using only 1 condition and i.e i-j+(n-1)

t=int(input())
for k in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    q=[list(map(int,input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    sums=[0]*(2*n-1)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            a=i-j+(n-1)
            sums[a]+=q[i][j]
    print(*sums)
