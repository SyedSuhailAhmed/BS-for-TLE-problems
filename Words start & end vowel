Given a list of words containing lowercase / uppercase English alphabets, you have to count the number of words between ith word and jth word that start and end with vowels.

Input Format
First line of input contains N - number of words. The next line contains N words, separated by space. The next line contains Q - number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains two integers i and j, separated by space.

Output Format
For each query, print the count for given [i, j], separated by newline.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Q <= 103

70 points
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Q <= 105

General Constraints
0 <= i <= j < N
1 <= len(word) <= 10

Example
Input
10
smart Ursula eerie code abyss Arjuna Expasito data Ace hacker
3
1 3
5 8
3 4

Output
2
3
0

Explanation

Test Case 1:
The words that start and end with vowels between [1,3] ie [Ursula, eerie, code] are: "Ursula", "eerie"

Test Case 2:
The words that start and end with vowels between [5,8] are: "Arjuna", "Expasito", "Ace"

Test Case 3:
There are no words that start and end with vowels between [3,4].
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we solve this by using a vowel array that has value 1 if a has vowel at both ends and a prefix array that is made from vowel array. and then we get answer by j-i of prefix array.

l=set('aeiouAEIOU')
n=int(input())
words=input().split()
p=[0]*(n+1)
vw=[]
for w in words:
    if w[0] in l and w[-1] in l:
        vw.append(1)
    else:
        vw.append(0)
for i in range(n):
    p[i+1]=p[i]+vw[i]
q=int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    print(p[b+1]-p[a])
